  abstract = {Studying life-history traits within and across taxonomic classifications has revealed many interesting and important patterns, but this approach to life history requires access to large compilations of data containing many different life-history parameters. Currently, life-history data for amniotes (birds, mammals, and reptiles) are split among a variety of publicly available databases, data tables embedded in individual papers and books, and species-specific studies by experts. Using data from this wide range of sources is a challenge for conducting macroecological studies because of a lack of standardization in taxonomic classifications, parameter values, and even in which parameters are reported. In order to facilitate comparative analyses between amniote life-history data, we created a database compiled from peer-reviewed studies on individual species, macroecological studies of multiple species, existing life-history databases, and other aggregated sources as well as published books and other compilations. First, we extracted and aggregated the raw data from the aforementioned sources. Next, we resolved spelling errors and other formatting inconsistencies in species names through a number of computational and manual methods. Once this was completed, subspecies-level data and species-level data were shared via a data-sharing algorithm to accommodate the variety of species transformations (taxonomic promotions, demotions, merges, divergences, etc.) that have occurred over time. Finally, in species where multiple raw data points were identified for a given parameter, we report the median value. Here, we report a normalized and consolidated database of up to 29 life-history parameters, containing at least one life-history parameter for 21{$\mkern1mu$}322 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Functional traits offer a rich quantitative framework for developing and testing theories in evolutionary biology, ecology and ecosystem science. However, the potential of functional traits to drive theoretical advances and refine models of global change can only be fully realised when species-level information is complete. Here we present the AVONET dataset containing comprehensive functional trait data for all birds, including six ecological variables, 11 continuous morphological traits, and information on range size and location. Raw morphological measurements are presented from 90,020 individuals of 11,009 extant bird species sampled from 181 countries. These data are also summarised as species averages in three taxonomic formats, allowing integration with a global phylogeny, geographical range maps, IUCN Red List data and the eBird citizen science database. The AVONET dataset provides the most detailed picture of continuous trait variation for any major radiation of organisms, offering a global template for testing hypotheses and exploring the evolutionary origins, structure and functioning of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Canada has begun an ambitious project to build an observing system to monitor the changing state of its biodiversity and ecosystems. A Canada-wide Biodiversity Observation Network (CAN BON) can support the measurement, mapping, and modelling of biodiversity change---the losses and gains in the diversity of plant, animal, and microbial life---and ecosystem services. This initiative responds to eight challenges presently constraining Canada's capacity to deliver timely and robust knowledge to achieve its biodiversity goals. CAN BON is conceived as a network connecting diverse organizations to support sustained biodiversity monitoring by collaboration among universities, museums, governments, industries, NGOs, community groups, and Indigenous organizations. This inclusive network will ``mobilize monitoring data'' to (1) combine observation and computing infrastructures and traditional knowledge to track and understand biodiversity losses and gains across the country; and (2) link the accumulated data and knowledge to models to inform the detection and attribution of biodiversity change needed to support biodiversity policy with forecasts from local to national levels. We expect that CAN BON will foster the mainstreaming of biodiversity data and knowledge into other sectors of the economy and society, and thereby support the technical and social innovation in Canada's transition to a nature-positive future.},

To achieve this, it focuses on the role of native and managed pollinators, the status and trends of pollinators and pollinator-plant networks and pollination, drivers of change, impacts on human well-being, food production in response to pollination declines and deficits and the effectiveness of responses.The chapters and their executive summaries of this assessment are available as document IPBES/4/INF/1/Rev.1 (www.ipbes.net).
